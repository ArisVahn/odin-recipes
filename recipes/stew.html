    <p><em>This beautiful bowl of old-fashioned beef barley soup would be perfect for your next superstorm. When it comes to stick-to-your-ribs stews, it doesn't get any better than shank.

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 thick slices beef shank</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>½ cup pearl barley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated raw horseradish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Season beef all over with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Cook beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir onion into the same pot with a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste; cook and stir until tomato paste is brick red, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in broth.</li>
        <li>Add celery, carrots, rosemary, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Return beef with any accumulated juices to the pot; push beef down to cover with cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cover the pot and cook until beef is fork tender, 2 to 3 hours. Remove beef to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour barley into cooking liquid in the pot; bring to a simmer and cook until barley is tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return beef to the pot. Cover the pot and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
    </ol>
